print() => print output on single line
println() => print output on next line
print("\n") => print output on next line

variable => store value in memory (value is change in future)

data type => (Java is typed language it means before define variable add datatype)
    1. Primitive datatype (built-in datatype)
        byte
        short
        char
        boolean
        int
        long
        float
        double
    
    2. Non-Primitive datatype (customized)
        String
        Array
        Class
        Object
        Interface

Keyword => Pre define words and this words are not use for our it's use for specific work

String => Strings are immutable in Java

operators => Symbols that tell compiler to perform some operations.

Binary operators => perform operations between 2 operators

Bitwise operator => &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

operators =>
        binary operators => +, -, *, /, %
        unary operators => ++, --
        relational operator => ==, !=, >, <, <=, >=
        Logical operator => &&, ||, !(a<b)
        bitwise operator => &, |, ^
        Assignment operators => =, +=, -=, *=, /=

Binary Number => 2 numbers (0 & 1)
binary number 0 to 7 => 
        0 => 000
        1 => 001
        2 => 010
        3 => 011
        4 => 100
        5 => 101
        6 => 110
        7 => 111

Octal number system => Base 8

Hexadecimal nuumber system => Base 16

True => 1
False => 0

Bit Manupulation => (this all operations are called bit mask)
        1. Get (find bit)
        2. Set (set bit on any position)
        3. Clear (bit in clear value or set 0)
        4. Update (Update bit)
